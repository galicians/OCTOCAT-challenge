Each time that we commit git creates several objects, one of this objects is the commit object.
The commit object has a pointer to the snapshot of the code at that moment in time and a pointer to the previous commit.
A branch is a movable pointer to one of this commit objects. It's movable because you can change at what commit object is pointing at.
As well you can create a branch with git branch 'branch_name' and move between branches with git checkout 'branch_name'
