When you want to propose changes, or to modify a project of another person(upstream, original owner). 
You do a fork(copy) of the original repository to your github
You clone the fork to download the project to your local machine.
Then when if you want the project on your computer reflecting inmediately the changes the author does you should use:

git remote add upstream upstream_url
